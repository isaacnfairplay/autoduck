Code: import duckdb

# Connect to an in-memory database
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create a table
con.execute('CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name VARCHAR, age INT)')

# Insert sample data
con.executemany('INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?, ?)', 
    [(1, 'Alice', 30), (2, 'Bob', 25), (3, 'Charlie', 35)])

# Query the data
result = con.execute('SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 25').fetchall()
