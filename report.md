Code: import duckdb

# Connect to an in-memory database
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create a table and insert data
con.execute('CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR, age INTEGER)')
con.execute('INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, "Alice", 30), (2, "Bob", 25)')

# Query data with filtering
result = con.execute('SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 27').fetchall()
print(result)
Explanation: Demonstrates creating a table, inserting data, and querying with a filter condition
