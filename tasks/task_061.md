# Task: I'm prepared to demonstrate a targeted DuckDB feature. Would you prefer a concise example exploring: 1) array_transform function, 2) window function ranking, 3) recursive query, or 4) custom aggregation method? I'll craft a small, illustrative implementation highlighting a specific DuckDB relational API capability.

```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create sample data with arrays
conn.sql("""
CREATE TABLE number_arrays AS
SELECT [1, 2, 3] AS original_array
UNION ALL
SELECT [4, 5, 6]
""")

# Use array_transform to square each array element
result = conn.sql("""
SELECT array_transform(original_array, x -> x * x) AS squared_array
FROM number_arrays
""").fetchall()

print(result)
```

**Result**: [([1, 4, 9],), ([16, 25, 36],)]

**Explanation**: Demonstrates DuckDB's array_transform function, which allows applying a lambda function to each element of an array, showcasing functional-style array manipulation within SQL.
