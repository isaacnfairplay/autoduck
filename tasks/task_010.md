```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create sample sales data
conn.sql("""
CREATE TABLE product_sales AS
SELECT 'Electronics' as category, 'Laptop' as product, 500.00 as price UNION ALL
SELECT 'Electronics', 'Smartphone', 800.00 UNION ALL

# Calculate cumulative sales and rank products within category
result = conn.sql("""
SELECT 
    category, 
    product, 
    price,
    SUM(price) OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price) as cumulative_category_sales,

FROM product_sales
""").fetchall()

for row in result:
    print(row)
```

**Result**: [('Electronics', 'Smartphone', Decimal('800.00'), Decimal('1300.00'), 1), ('Electronics', 'Laptop', Decimal('500.00'), Decimal('500.00'), 2), ('Clothing', 'Jeans', Decimal('100.00'), Decimal('150.00'), 1), ('Clothing', 'Shirt', Decimal('50.00'), Decimal('50.00'), 2)]

**Explanation**: Demonstrates window functions in DuckDB using cumulative sales calculation and product ranking within categories
