## Step 1: I'm ready to proceed with a comprehensive DuckDB relational API example. Based on your request, I'll focus on creating a sophisticated demonstration that explores advanced querying techniques, multi-table joins, and relation manipulation. Would you like me to draft a detailed code example showcasing these features?

```python
import duckdb

# Establish in-memory database connection
conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create sample relations for multi-table analysis
conn.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE employees (emp_id INT, name STRING, department STRING, salary DECIMAL);
    CREATE TABLE departments (dept_id STRING, dept_name STRING, location STRING);

    INSERT INTO employees VALUES 
        (1, 'Alice', 'Sales', 50000),
        (2, 'Bob', 'Engineering', 75000),
        (3, 'Charlie', 'Marketing', 60000);

    INSERT INTO departments VALUES 
        ('Sales', 'Sales Department', 'New York'),
        ('Engineering', 'Tech Division', 'San Francisco'),
        ('Marketing', 'Marketing Team', 'Chicago');
''')

# Demonstrate advanced relational API techniques
employee_relation = conn.table('employees')
department_relation = conn.table('departments')

# Complex join with window function
advanced_query = employee_relation.join(
    department_relation, 
    'employees.department = departments.dept_id'
).select([
    'employees.name', 
    'departments.location', 
    'employees.salary', 
    'AVG(employees.salary) OVER (PARTITION BY departments.dept_name) as dept_avg_salary'
])

# Execute and display results
print(advanced_query.execute().fetchall())
```

**Result**: None

**Explanation**: This example demonstrates DuckDB's relational API by creating in-memory tables, performing a complex join between employees and departments, and using a window function to calculate departmental average salaries. The code showcases multi-table relationships, projection, and analytical query techniques.
