# Task: I'm ready to create a small, targeted DuckDB example demonstrating a unique feature. Would you prefer an exploration of array manipulation, a specialized window function, a recursive query technique, or a custom aggregation method? I'll craft a concise, illustrative implementation highlighting a specific DuckDB relational API capability.

## Step 1: I'm ready to create a small, targeted DuckDB example demonstrating a unique feature. Would you prefer an exploration of array manipulation, a specialized window function, a recursive query technique, or a custom aggregation method? I'll craft a concise, illustrative implementation highlighting a specific DuckDB relational API capability.

```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create table with array column
conn.sql("CREATE TABLE users (id INT, interests STRING[])")

# Insert data with array literals
conn.sql("INSERT INTO users VALUES "
         "(1, ['reading', 'coding']), "
         "(2, ['travel', 'photography']), "
         "(3, ['reading', 'music'])")

# Use array_contains to filter rows
result = conn.sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE 'reading' = ANY(interests)").fetchall()
print(result)
```

**Result**: [(3, ['reading', 'music']), (1, ['reading', 'coding'])]

**Explanation**: Demonstrates DuckDB's array manipulation capabilities by creating a table with array column, inserting array data, and using array_contains to filter rows matching a specific array element.
