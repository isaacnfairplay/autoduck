# Task: Would you like a focused example demonstrating one of these DuckDB capabilities?

1. Array transformation with array_transform
2. Window function ranking
3. Recursive query generation
4. Custom aggregation method

I'll craft a small, targeted implementation highlighting a specific DuckDB relational API capability.

## Step 1: Would you like a focused example demonstrating one of these DuckDB capabilities?

```python
import duckdb

# Create an in-memory database with sales data
conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create and populate sales table
conn.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE sales (
        product_id INTEGER,
        sale_date DATE,
        quantity INTEGER,
        price DECIMAL(10,2)
    );

    INSERT INTO sales VALUES
        (1, '2023-01-15', 5, 100.50),
        (1, '2023-02-20', 3, 100.50),
        (2, '2023-01-15', 2, 250.00),
        (2, '2023-03-10', 4, 250.00);
""")

# Window function: Calculate cumulative sales per product
result = conn.sql("""
    SELECT 
        product_id, 
        sale_date, 
        quantity,
        SUM(quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sale_date) as cumulative_quantity
    FROM sales
    ORDER BY product_id, sale_date
""").fetchall()

for row in result:
    print(row)
```

**Result**: [(1, datetime.date(2023, 1, 15), 5, 5), (1, datetime.date(2023, 2, 20), 3, 8), (2, datetime.date(2023, 1, 15), 2, 2), (2, datetime.date(2023, 3, 10), 4, 6)]

**Explanation**: Demonstrates DuckDB window function using cumulative sales calculation, showing how to partition and order results within a single table.
## Step 2: 1. Array transformation with array_transform

**Generated by**: Anthropic

```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create an array and transform its elements
result = conn.sql("""
    SELECT array_transform([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x -> x * 2) AS doubled_array
""").fetchone()[0]

print(result)  # Expected output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

**Result**: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

**Explanation**: Demonstrates DuckDB's array_transform function, which applies a lambda function to each element of an input array, creating a new array with transformed values.
## Step 3: 2. Window function ranking

**Generated by**: Anthropic

```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create products table with sales
conn.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id INTEGER,
        category VARCHAR,
        price DECIMAL(10,2)
    );

    INSERT INTO products VALUES
        (1, 'Electronics', 500.00),
        (2, 'Electronics', 750.00),
        (3, 'Clothing', 100.00),
        (4, 'Clothing', 200.00);
""")

# Rank products within category by price using DENSE_RANK()
result = conn.sql("""
    SELECT 
        product_id, 
        category, 
        price,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) as price_rank
    FROM products
""").fetchall()

for row in result:
    print(row)
```

**Result**: [(2, 'Electronics', Decimal('750.00'), 1), (1, 'Electronics', Decimal('500.00'), 2), (4, 'Clothing', Decimal('200.00'), 1), (3, 'Clothing', Decimal('100.00'), 2)]

**Explanation**: Demonstrates window function ranking using DENSE_RANK() to rank products within their category by price, showing how products are ranked without skipping ranks
