```python
import duckdb

conn = duckdb.connect(':memory:')

# Create array and transform each element
result = conn.execute("""
    SELECT array_transform([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x -> x * x) as squared_array
""").fetchall()

print(result)  # Output: [[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]]
```

**Result**: [([1, 4, 9, 16, 25],)]

**Explanation**: Demonstrates DuckDB's array_transform function, which applies a lambda function to each element of an array, creating a new array by squaring each numeric value.
